    <h2>Role and Functions</h2>
    <p>The role of the City Assessment Department is clearly expressed in Section 80 of Act 21 of 1990:</p>
    <blockquote>“The Assessor shall ascertain and assess the annual rateable value of each rateable hereditament within the city and record the names of owners, occupiers or tenants thereof and submit to Council for the fixing of the House Rate payable before March 31, each year.”</blockquote>
    <p>The core functions of the City Assessor’s Department are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculation and determination of Lease Rental for Corporation Properties.</li>
        <li>Processing of Return of Ownership.</li>
        <li>Valuation of Hereditaments within the city limits.</li>
        <li>Numbering and re-numbering of hereditaments.</li>
        <li>Mergers and sub-division of properties.</li>
        <li>Preparing and maintenance of House Rate Books.</li>
        <li>Preparing and Issuing of House Rate Notices.</li>
        <li>Research Data Collection and Analysis/Market Intelligence.</li>
        <li>Technical advice on Valuation Matters.</li>
        <li>Servicing the public and other State Agencies such as WASA and T&TEC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Departmental Information</h2>
    <p>The City Assessor’s Departmental staff comprises:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One (1) Deputy City Assessor (Ag.)</li>
        <li>One (1) Valuation Assistant</li>
        <li>One (1) Clerk II</li>
        <li>One (1) Clerk/Typist</li>
        <li>One (1) Female Labourer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The City Assessor’s Department is responsible for determining the projected income to be received/collected by the corporation for House Rates on an annual basis. However, for the period under review (October 2015 to September 2016), no annual collectable was determined.</p>

    <h2>Impact of Property Tax Reform</h2>
    <p>The Property Tax Reform and the subsequent Act Nos. 17 and 18 of 2009 (which repealed Part V of the Act 21 of 1990) led to the cessation of most functions of the department. However, the department continued to service the public with ownership matters and provided information to other government agencies.</p>

    <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
    <p>The City Assessor’s Department provided the public with information, issuing letters to state agencies, and following up on queries daily. The department also provided deed information to search clerks of the Ministry of Legal Affairs, Valuation Division, and other private law firms. They prepared and maintained House Rate Books for approximately 15,000 hereditaments within the city, with new additions such as Bayside Towers and Pelham Street apartments.</p>

    <p>Upon the resumption of Property Tax, this would result in additional revenue for the Corporation. However, due to the suspension of the Property Tax in 2009, it is difficult to project any annual collectable for the Corporation.</p>
